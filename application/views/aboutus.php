 ">Hello and welcome to Our Site. 
This is Masuma Sulatana, Zayed Hassan, Jahid Mahmud, Aminul Islam- Developers of The Site.

</br>
We studied in the same university & same year. This is one of our many ideas that we shared in leisure as classmate.
We felt that there is not enough information about market price of products in web sites from Bangladesh.
Moreover, the sites that provide market price are sometimes not updated time to time. 
So we have taken this initiative and we are still struggling to collect market information.
We strongly feel that information is one of the most precious things to get in this country.</p></strong>
